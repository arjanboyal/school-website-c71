            <h1>WE ENSURE A BETTER EDUCATUAIN <br> FOR BETTER WORLD</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome back and Happy New Year to everyone!
                We hope you enjoyed some much-deserved quality time with your children during the holidays. With a challenging year behind us, we look forward to a hopeful 2021. This year
                brings a sense a hope for a promising future with the roll-out of vaccinations world-wide. In
                the meantime, we will continue to stay vigilant about COVID safety protocols at school. We
                certainly appreciate all you are doing at your end to ensure children stay home when they are
                not well.
                On Monday we welcomed returning students with a special welcome back for those returning
                to full time school from the districtâ€™s Blended program. We started the morning with a short
                but important assembly online to review our safety protocols including our designated playground areas. With close to 40 students returning, we added 2 new Face-to-Face Divisions
                including a grade 5/6 with Ms. Brogno and a grade 2/3 with Ms. Archer. We appreciate that
                for some students in both our Face-to-Face and Blended programs, the return to school this
                week meant the introduction to a new teacher and new classmates. Students appeared to
                settle quickly into their new learning community and are well positioned for a positive and
                productive second term of learning.
